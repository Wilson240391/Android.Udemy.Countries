Dagger2, MVVM, Kotlin, RxJava, Retrofit, Mockito and Glide

MVVM architecture using the Google recommended Android Lifecycle Extensions

Dagger2 for dependency injection

RxJava as a reactive framework

Retrofit and JSON for remote server communication

Glide for seamless image loading

Unit tests to test the application and make it stable and robust

And we will build everything in Kotlin, the shiny new language that Google recommends
